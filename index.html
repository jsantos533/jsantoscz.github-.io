			<p>The automotive industry is constantly evolving, with new technologies and trends emerging every year. In recent years, we have seen a rise in the popularity of electric and hybrid cars, as well as the development of self-driving vehicles. In this article, we will explore some of the latest types of cars that are currently on the market.

                <h4>Electric Cars</h4>
                
                Electric cars have been around for several years now, but they are becoming increasingly popular due to their environmental benefits and low running costs. These cars are powered by electric motors, which are fueled by rechargeable batteries.

                Self-driving cars are one of the most exciting new technologies in the automotive industry. These vehicles are designed to be able to navigate roads and traffic without any input from a human driver.
